# Question
Please define what each HTTP verb does. Then, provide an example of when you would use it.

- GET
- POST
- PUT/PATCH
- DELETE

# Answer
1. GET - Retrieving data: You would use this when you want to get data from an API you're using, like getting a new random dog image from the url of that random dog image generator. 

2. POST - posting new data: using this to post or put new data into the server to alter it. Say when you post on instagram, the picture doesn't (just) exist locally on your phone. It exists on the servers that hold the information about your account and what you add to it.

3. PUT/PATCH - put fully updates a program on the server side by replacing all of its code, patch only replaces some. both are mainly to update or fix the program. Put would be used if you had a whole new GUI with new features in place, whereas patch would be for that bug you get where the app freezes.

4. DELETE - deletes the specified resource, meaning it just deletes code. Deleting unnecessary code or refreshing could be possible purposes.

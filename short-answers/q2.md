# Question

What is the "Request/Response Cycle?"

# Answer
The Request/Response cycle occurs when you have two computers or programs communicating with one anotherâ€” one is considered the client, the other is considered the server. The client is the one who starts the "conversation" by sending a request to the *server*, which stores some sort of data that the client is specifically looking for. The client's request asks for the data from the server, and depending on the circumstances, the server is able to provide a response containing said data. There are status codes and messages provided by the server to tell the client whether this data was able to be successfully fetched or not.

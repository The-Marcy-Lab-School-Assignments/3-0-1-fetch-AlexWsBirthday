# Question

Who sends the HTTP status code: the client or the server? What is the point of the status code?

# Answer
The server sends the HTTP status code in order to let the client know what happened on the server's end of things during a fetch. This can also be a code that tells you that the client may have messed up in its request, but it's still coming from the server.

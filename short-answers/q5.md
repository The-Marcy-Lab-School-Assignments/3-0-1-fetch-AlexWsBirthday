# Question
What are the two arguments that we pass into `fetch` and what do they do? What does `fetch` return?

# Answer
Two Arguments: 

1. string URL, the source that fetch goes to retrieve the data from. The target, so to speak

2. An optional argument to specify the type of request you're making to the database. If you only want data, the string URL is enough

fetch() returns a promise that resolves with a response object.

# Question
`fetch` returns a promise of the `Response` object. It has a lot of useful properties on it. Can you explain what each of these properties are for?

- `Response.ok`
- `Response.status`
- `Response.url`
- `Response.headers`

# Answer

1. `Response.ok` - Checking that the response is okay 

2. `Response.status` -  Checking the status of the response and seeing what kind of error/information is being retrieved

3. `Response.url` - Printing the url of the source of the response 

4. `Response.headers` - Retrieving, creating, adding to, deleting from the list of headers within the request data
